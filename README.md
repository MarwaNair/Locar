# Locar
Locar is a mobile application project that provides advanced geolocation capabilities to users via their smartphones. It includes two applications: the User Application and the Car Application. Additionally, we developed a web-based platform that allows users to access the geolocation services on their desktops.

## User Application
The User Application enables users to request the precise location of their vehicle(s) and receive real-time GPS coordinates via SMS. Users can also view the location of their vehicle(s) on a map within the application.

## Car Application
The Car Application is responsible for detecting the user's request for location and sending the vehicle's GPS coordinates to the user via SMS. It also sends the GPS coordinates of the vehicle to the database at predefined intervals.

## Web-Based Platform
The web-based platform allows users to request the GPS position of their vehicle(s) at predefined intervals or specific times. They can also view the route taken by their vehicle(s) on a map at defined intervals.

## Technology
The applications were built using advanced sensor technology and geolocation algorithms to provide highly accurate GPS positioning. We used React Native for the Android applications development and React JS and Firebase for the web-app development.
